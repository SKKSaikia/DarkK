!#rule1: DO NOT TRUST ANYONE: Even the cute websites about Dark-Net in the Surface-Web giving out information on "How to access" might be feds. This might prove fatal, getting tracked from here on. Use VPN from day 0.<br/>
!# rule: Posting only the <b>cute pictures</b>, not taking the brutal road. <br/>
!# rule: 9 is a special number: Cypher: Caeser,shift:9 <br/>

# H4CK3RS 4BO4RD
Curious & Excited, when I discovered ["DEFCON"](https://www.defcon.org/) back in 2008. I was so soaked up in this world that I started learning Hacking ; Networking, would set up VMs of [Parrot](https://www.parrotsec.org/), [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) - explore [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), [nmap](https://nmap.org/), [metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) etc. Later trying out phishing, SQL Injection and stuff, to figure out how cool they were. This is a totally different world, Totally !!! You feel the power in your hands, the world at the tip of your fingers. But, to be honest , it was just the beginnning and I was a n00b / script kiddie.

Back in the early 2015 Winters, I waited for the [Phoenix](https://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tpbsite.jpg) to turn into the [HYDRA](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/The_Pirate_Bay_hydra_logo.jpg) once again (" HAIL HYDRA! "). Though X understands, Torrenting copyrighted content isn't a good thing, but for people who do not have money/resources, cannot afford to pay for overpriced $$ contents but wishes to learn and eleviate oneself, must be served. These contents would help bridge the gap of knowledge and to become a better human resource [LEARN.RISE.EARN.PAY]. Also, Do not pay for $hitty contents, if you really enjoyed something, please do support the Developers / Creators by purchasing from original store. X was from pretty far off / lived in a remote place, and spent a lotta time with friends and well wishers in tpb (thepiratebay) & kat (kickasstorrents) ; X was active in IRC; RUSSIAN trackers [tparser / ru-tracker] and forums [bakabt-kat]; spent a lotta time getting contents from Russians / and other sources and putting them up in kat/tpb. LOT of DMCA's / Lotta Threats , those days were fun "for X" ; and was living the days of his life. X was serious and commited; spent on Hardware [16+ TB] with transfer logs of around ~ 4 TB/month. 

Apart from Seeding/ I was following the WORLD-NEWS out there, with Kevin Mitnick's book "Ghost in the Wires" in one hand and his documentary "[Freedom Downtime](https://youtu.be/77ILA5Cso3w)" in front, I was learning all. How sabu (aka Hector Monsegur the leader) of [LulzSec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LulzSec), finally had to work with law until the arrest of other members - [topiary](https://youtu.be/DurOYPdXyF4), tflow etc, Projects of [Anonymous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)), high profile hacks of [Lizard Squad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard_Squad) etc. /Trackers were full of Hacked dumps ; Aaron Swartz - JSTOR dumps ; email dumps ; Wikileaks dumps and Edward Snowden files. Exciting times indeed.

Later felt the need of core skills of Networking & Systems to get into Security with Programming at forefront; I learned ICND1 and ICND2 } [CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna-routing-switching.html) , traversed packets with [GNS3](https://www.gns3.com/) and almost bought Hardware (switches and routers) such craziness !!!. [CBTNuggets](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/) was the king at that time, also Chris Bryant teaches good stuff. Made plans of [CCNA>CCNP>CCIE](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications.html)>[CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP) | [CEH>ECSA>LPT](https://www.eccouncil.org/programs/certified-ethical-hacker-ceh/) but never gave the exams, I realized , this field is my hobby and wouldn't want to take it up as a career. Jack of All/Master of One.
